# Prediction-of-survived
Here I propose to consider the most popular Kaggle competition. The Titanic shipwreck was one of the biggest water disasters.  In this notebook, I want to test a few simple hypotheses that the survival of people on a ship depends on certain aspects, such as age, gender, and social class. Also, I compared some of the more popular ensemble methods.
